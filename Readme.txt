Summary.doc - An overview of the project purpose, implementation, and my experience doing the project

CPU.java -    This file simulates the actions of a CPU. It has most of the functionality and calls on the Memory file for program instructions
	      to follow.  

Memory.java - This file simulates main memory. It stores and organizes all of the instructions of a program file so the CPU
 	      can access them 
Sample5.txt - This program prints out a 4 x 4 multiplication table. 


Instructions:
First download the folder containing all files and remember where they are stored. Next open up the terminal and 
navigate to the location that the folder is located. Next compile the CPU.java file by typing "javac CPU.java".
Do the same thing for the Memory.java file; "javac Memory.java". Once both programs have been compiled you can
run the main class to execute a program. Type in "java CPU Sample5.txt 10" to run Sample5. The first argument is the program to 
be executed and the second argument is the amount the timer is set to. You can now run any of the other test 
programs by using the same command as before but replacing the name of the program file with the file you wish
to run. Also, you can change the time argument to whatever you would like.
